# GraphOS Skill: graph-world

Design world logic in GraphOS with a node-first architecture for any game or application.

This skill depends on `graph-management` for graph inspection and transaction apply APIs.

## Node Semantics

- World: Single root context of the whole model. The World node name is fixed to `World`.
- Context: Hierarchical domain/data model node under World or Context. Context belongs to the logical/data layer, not the presentation layer, but should expose the state that the View layer needs to observe. Context also has built-in storage semantics, so logic should prefer reusing existing Context instances/state before creating new ones.
- Variant: Typed variable definition under World or Context. Variant is the default design surface for persistent/stored runtime data.
- System: Lifecycle logic node under World or Context. Temporary cache or ephemeral working state should be handled inside the owning System rather than modeled as stored graph data.
- Event: World-level event definition.
- EventSystem: Event-driven handler under Event.

## When to Use

- You are designing a new game/app world model from scratch.
- You need to convert business domains into nested Context trees.
- You need typed data variables (Variant) before writing lifecycle logic.
- You need event-driven initialization or runtime flows (for example game startup).
- You need to bootstrap a fresh npm + TypeScript world project with GraphOS generation config.

## Preconditions

1. Load and use `graph-management` skill first.
2. Read available node types and current graph state before mutation.
3. Use one coherent transaction per design step when possible.

## Project Bootstrap (npm + TypeScript)

Use this when the user asks to initialize a new world logic project.

1. Initialize npm project and install TypeScript + Node typings:

```bash
npm init -y
npm i -D typescript @types/node
```

2. Install `graphos-world-plugin` as dev dependency:

```bash
npm i -D graphos-world-plugin
```

3. Ensure `package.json` contains the following `graphos` config:

```json
{
   "graphos": {
      "world": {
         "genTypeScript": {
            "enabled": true,
            "outDir": "gen"
         },
         "genCocosCreator": {
            "enabled": false,
            "outDir": "../cocos/assets/gen"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

4. Ensure `package.json` scripts includes:

```json
{
   "scripts": {
      "graphos": "graphos"
   }
}
```

5. Optional verification:

```bash
npm run graphos -- --help
```

## Modification Rules (Mandatory Order)

These rules are hard constraints for any change workflow:

1. Data model and data logic changes must be applied to Graph first.
   - Complete required Context/Variant/System/Event/EventSystem updates in Graph before writing downstream code/docs/tasks.
2. Validate Graph logic is closed-loop immediately after Graph changes.
   - Run the Step 4 closure checks and ensure all closure dimensions pass.
3. Only after closed-loop validation passes, proceed to any other tasks.
   - If closure fails, return to Graph patching first; do not continue with non-Graph work.
4. After every successful graph change, update `gen/README.md` with a change record.
   - Record what was added/modified/removed and why.
   - Append to the change log section; do not overwrite previous records.
5. After every successful graph change, update `gen/GRAPH.md` with the complete current process diagram and closure checkpoints.
   - Keep the diagram in sync with the actual Step 0-6 workflow.
   - Validate that the diagram remains closed-loop (failed checks route back to patch steps).

## Procedure

### Step 0: Read Current State

1. Call `get_available_node_types` to validate node schemas.
2. Call `get_graph_description` to identify current root, contexts, and gaps.
3. If extending an existing area, call `get_graph_node` on the focus node.

Completion check:
- You know whether a World node already exists.
- You know where new Context/Variant/System/Event nodes should be attached.

### Step 1: Build Data Model and Variants

Goal: create the structural model first, then type its data.

1. Ensure exactly one `World` root exists.
   - The root node name must be exactly `World`; do not rename it or create alternative root names.
2. Create `Context` tree by domain boundaries:
   - Broad to specific: e.g. `Gameplay` -> `Player` -> `Inventory`.
   - Keep sibling contexts cohesive and low-coupling.
3. Under each relevant `World`/`Context`, add `Variant` nodes:
   - Set `name` with stable semantic naming.
   - Set `type` from `string|float|integer|boolean|JSONSchema`.
   - If `type=JSONSchema`, provide `jsonSchema` with required fields.
   - Mark `required` only for truly mandatory runtime data.
4. Apply the transaction and re-read graph.

Decision points:
- Use `Context` when modeling a domain boundary or ownership scope.
- Use `Variant` when modeling typed data inside a scope, especially when the requirement includes storage/persistence.
- Prefer `JSONSchema` only for structured objects; otherwise use primitive types.
- If data must survive as part of the graph-defined state, design it as a `Variant`.
- If data is only a temporary cache, intermediate computation result, or frame-local working set, keep it inside the relevant `System` instead of adding a `Variant`.
- Graph design should contain logical/domain state only, not presentation-layer widgets, styles, animations, or rendering concerns.
- Design `Context` and its `Variant`s so the View layer can react to data changes through observation/binding.
- If the View depends on explicit runtime states such as loading, selected, active, disabled, visible, phase, or mode, model those as logical state in `Context`/`Variant` rather than leaving them implicit in the presentation layer.

Completion check:
- Every core domain has a Context owner.
- Every runtime-critical datum has a Variant with explicit type.
- No orphan Variants without a clear World/Context parent.

### Step 2: Define Systems Based on the Data Model

Goal: bind lifecycle behavior to existing data model scopes.

1. For each behavior unit, create a `System` under its owning `World`/`Context`.
2. Define required lifecycle entry points by implementation contract:
   - `spawn`, `despawn`, `update`, `change`.
3. Document each implemented lifecycle method with clear intent, trigger, and target data scope.
4. Ensure system responsibilities align with nearby Context/Variant ownership.
5. Apply and verify topology.

Decision points:
- Place System at the nearest scope that owns the data it mutates.
- Use `Spawn` for initialization, `Update` for recurring logic, `Change` for reactive sync, `Despawn` for cleanup.
- Split a System when a single node spans unrelated responsibilities.
- `System` implementation should contain no presentation-layer logic (rendering, styling, animation, UI orchestration).
- `System` logic should be driven by `Context`/`Variant` state and domain rules only.
- Keep temporary cache data internal to the owning `System`; do not promote cache-only state into graph `Variant`s unless it must be stored as part of the domain model.

Completion check:
- Each implemented lifecycle method has a matching description.
- Systems are attached to the correct World/Context scope.
- No lifecycle method exists without a clear trigger and data target.

TypeScript example (implement System after Graph is validated):

```ts
import type { GameplayContext } from './gen/World.js'; // graph auto-generated TypeScript types
import type { ISystem } from 'graphos-world-plugin';

export function createGameBootstrapSystem(): ISystem<GameplayContext> {
   // optional internal cache for the System; not exposed to presentation layer
   return {
      spawn(ctx: GameplayContext): void {
         // TODO
      },
      despawn(ctx: GameplayContext): void {
         // TODO
      },
      update(ctx: GameplayContext, deltaTime: number): void {
         // TODO
      },
      change(ctx: GameplayContext): void {
         // TODO
      },
   };
}
```

Implementation guidance:
- Keep method behavior aligned with the closure checks in Step 4.
- Do not implement business logic before Graph data model and ownership are finalized.
- If Graph changes update generated context types, regenerate types first, then update this System implementation.
- Keep presentation behavior outside `System`; the View layer should react by observing `Context` data changes.
- Intermediate cache should be handled privately inside each `System` and should not leak into presentation concerns.
- Do not create module-level or global cache/state for `System` implementations.
- Any cache must live inside the `create...System` factory function scope (closure) so each created system instance owns its own cache.
- Put shared data contracts, constants, and Context singleton ids/names used by generated `System` code into `src/types.ts`, then import them from `System` files.
- Put runtime configuration into `src/config.ts` and read it from generated `System` logic; prefer configurable defaults over hard-coded values.
- When generating `System` code files, use PascalCase file names and keep them exactly aligned with the graph `System` node `name`.
- Example: graph node `GameBootstrapSystem` -> file `GameBootstrapSystem.ts`.
- Since `Context` provides storage capability, implement a get-or-create pattern in `System` logic: fetch existing Context/state first, and create/initialize only when missing.
- For singleton `Context` access in `System` implementations, use a fixed id with `get...ById('id')`.
- Do not fetch singleton `Context` instances through positional access such as `get...Children()[0]`, because order-based lookup is unstable and obscures identity.
- After implementing a `System`, register it in `src/app.ts` with `app.addSystem(...)`; generated code is not complete until runtime registration is wired.

### Step 3: Define Events and EventSystems

Goal: model event-driven flows after data and lifecycle foundations are stable.

1. Under `World`, create `Event` nodes for key domain events:
   - Examples: `GameStarted`, `UserRegistered`, `SessionRestored`.
2. If event payload is needed, attach `Variant` nodes under each `Event`.
3. Under each `Event`, create `EventSystem` handlers:
   - Describe how handlers create/init/update Context instances.
4. Apply transaction and verify event-to-handler completeness.

Decision points:
- Create an `Event` for cross-context or explicit trigger boundaries.
- Use `EventSystem` when handling should be decoupled from per-frame System logic.
- For bootstrap flows, prefer an explicit startup/boot event plus handler.
- For UI-facing events, keep the Event data model as small as possible and prefer defining no payload fields unless data is strictly required.

Completion check:
- Every critical trigger has an Event.
- Every Event has at least one intended EventSystem handler (or explicitly documented as future work).
- Event payload Variants match handler input expectations.

TypeScript example (implement EventSystem after Graph trigger chain is validated):

```ts
import type { ChickenMergeLiteWorldContext, IChickenShootEvent } from './gen/World.js'; // graph auto-generated TypeScript types
import type { ISystem } from 'graphos-world-plugin';

export type SpawnBulletOnShootEventSystem = ISystem<ChickenMergeLiteWorldContext, IChickenShootEvent>;

export function createSpawnBulletOnShootEventSystem(): SpawnBulletOnShootEventSystem {
   // optional internal cache for the System; not exposed to presentation layer
   return {
      handle(event: IChickenShootEvent): void {
         // TODO
      },
   };
}
```

Implementation guidance:
- Ensure Event payload fields are defined in Graph and match `IChickenShootEvent`.
- For events consumed mainly by the presentation/UI layer, prefer signal-style Events with no payload; add fields only when the UI cannot derive the required state from `Context`.
- Keep `handle` side effects scoped to the owning Context and verified by Step 4 trigger closure.
- If Event or payload schema changes in Graph, regenerate `./gen/World.js` types before updating EventSystem code.
- Do not create module-level or global cache/state for `EventSystem` implementations.
- Any cache must live inside the `create...EventSystem` factory function scope (closure) so each created event-system instance owns its own cache.
- Put shared data contracts, constants, and Context singleton ids/names used by generated `EventSystem` code into `src/types.ts`, then import them from `EventSystem` files.
- Put runtime configuration into `src/config.ts` and read it from generated `EventSystem` logic; prefer configurable defaults over hard-coded values.
- When generating `EventSystem` code files, use PascalCase file names and keep them exactly aligned with the graph `EventSystem` node `name`.
- Example: graph node `SpawnBulletOnShootEventSystem` -> file `SpawnBulletOnShootEventSystem.ts`.
- Since `Context` provides storage capability, `EventSystem` handlers should fetch target Context/state first and create/initialize only when it does not exist.
- For singleton `Context` access in `EventSystem` implementations, use a fixed id with `get...ById('id')`.
- Do not resolve singleton `Context` instances through `get...Children()[0]` or any other position-based child lookup.
- After implementing an `EventSystem`, register it in `src/app.ts` with `app.addEventSystem(...)`; event handlers are incomplete until the app entry wires them.

Application registration example (`src/app.ts`):

```ts
import { App } from 'graphos-world-plugin';
import { MatchLoopContext, WorldContext } from '../gen/World';
import { createMatchLifecycleSystem } from './MatchLifecycleSystem';
import { createApplyConfigHotReloadEventSystem } from './ApplyConfigHotReloadEventSystem';

export default function (app: App): WorldContext {
   app.addSystem(MatchLoopContext.Table, createMatchLifecycleSystem());
   app.addEventSystem('ConfigHotReloadRequested', createApplyConfigHotReloadEventSystem());
   return WorldContext.default(app.ctx, app.cache)!;
}
```

Registration guidance:
- Register every generated `System` and `EventSystem` in `src/app.ts`.
- Keep imported symbol names aligned with the generated PascalCase file names and graph node names.
- Use the owning Context table when calling `app.addSystem(...)`.
- Use the exact graph `Event` name when calling `app.addEventSystem(...)`.

### Step 4: Closed-Loop Validation and Completion

Goal: verify the model is end-to-end closed-loop; if not, patch missing links and re-validate.

1. Run full validation after Step 1-3:
   - Re-run `get_graph_description` and compare expected topology with actual graph.
   - Optionally inspect key nodes with `get_graph_node` (World, core Contexts, bootstrap Event).
2. Validate closure dimensions:
   - Structural closure: single World root, no orphan Context/Variant/System/Event/EventSystem.
   - Data closure: each critical runtime datum exists as typed Variant and has owner scope.
   - Behavior closure: each implemented lifecycle method has a concrete description and target data.
   - Trigger closure: bootstrap and key domain triggers map to Event -> EventSystem -> target Context updates.
   - Transaction closure: all apply results are successful, or retries resolved partial failures.
3. If any closure check fails, classify and patch gaps in one focused transaction batch:
   - Missing structure/data -> go back to Step 1.
   - Missing lifecycle method coverage -> go back to Step 2.
   - Missing event trigger/handler chain -> go back to Step 3.
4. Re-run closure validation until all dimensions pass.
5. Produce final verification summary:
   - Added nodes/edges.
   - Remaining deferred items (if any) with explicit reason.
   - Confirmation that the model is closed-loop and ready for next iteration.

Completion check:
- All five closure dimensions pass.
- No unresolved critical gap remains.
- Final graph description matches intended domain design.

### Step 5: Update gen/README.md Change Log

Goal: persist a human-readable record of every graph mutation session.

1. Open (or create) `gen/README.md`.
2. Append a new change record under a `## Change Log` section using the format below:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short summary>

**Added**
- <node type> `<node name>` under `<parent>`: <reason>

**Modified**
- <node type> `<node name>`: <what changed and why>

**Removed**
- <node type> `<node name>`: <reason>

**Notes**
- <any closure gaps deferred, design decisions, or follow-up items>
```

3. Do not overwrite previous records — always append.
4. Keep each entry concise (one line per node change is sufficient).

Completion check:
- `gen/README.md` exists and contains an up-to-date change record for this session.
- All added/modified/removed nodes are listed.
- Deferred items or known gaps are noted.

### Step 6: Update gen/GRAPH.md Full Flow Diagram

Goal: keep an executable process diagram artifact that reflects the current workflow and closure loop.

1. Open (or create) `gen/GRAPH.md`.
2. Maintain one complete Mermaid flowchart for the end-to-end process:
   - Include Step 0 to Step 6.
   - Include closure dimensions and retry loops for failed checks.
3. After each graph mutation session, update the diagram if any step, gate, or retry path changed.
4. Validate closed-loop correctness in the diagram:
   - Any failed closure/gate must route back to the correct patch step.
   - Success path must end at final verification summary.

Completion check:
- `gen/GRAPH.md` exists and contains the latest complete flowchart.
- The flowchart includes all active steps (0-6) and retry branches.
- Diagram closure is verified: no broken success/failure path and no missing back-edge.

## Quality Gates (Final Review)

1. Structure gate: exactly one World root and coherent Context tree.
2. Type gate: Variants are typed correctly; JSONSchema nodes contain valid schema text.
3. Ownership gate: Systems and Variants are attached to the scope that owns their data.
4. Event gate: Event/EventSystem pairs cover bootstrap and key domain triggers.
5. Verification gate: re-run `get_graph_description` after each apply and confirm expected node/edge deltas.
6. Diagram gate: `gen/GRAPH.md` is updated and reflects the current closed-loop workflow.
